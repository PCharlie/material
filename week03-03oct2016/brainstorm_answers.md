# Part 1 - Brainstorm: Statistics

## Distributions
### e.g., Gaussian, Poisson, ..

## Statistical Models
## Methods for Estimation
## Methods for Hypothesis Testing

# Part 2 - Brainstorm: Technologies in Biology

## microarray, sequencing, etc.

## In-class exercise 1 (1 technology for each row): microarray, Illumina seq, other types of seq

### Goal: 
#### produce a 2-3 point summary
#### links to a few (<5) good resources
#### add your description to the #technology_day slack channel (add all github usernames of your group!)

# Part 3 - Brainstorm: Applications in genomics 

### e.g., gene expression

# Part 4 - Brainstorm: Linking Technologies to Applications to Statistics (mainstream)

## e.g., microarray -> gene expression -> normally distributed (log intensities)

## In-class exercise 2 (in groups/rows): 
### Goal: make the link between technologies, what is measured, statistical models used
### For example:
##### RNA-seq: sequencing -> gene expression -> ?
##### BS-seq: bisulphite + sequencing -> DNA methylation -> ?
##### ChIP-seq: sequencing -> protein/DNA interactions -> ?


# Part 5 - Brainstorm: Methods/algorithms/data structures that are associated more to computer science

# Part 6 - Pick another "technology" (from those above or from [1]) to briefly describe

Technology: RAD Seq

Technology		  Application		                              Statistical Model
RAD Sequencing	Identification of genetic variation (SNPs)	Bayesian (genotype likelihood)

Inexpensive platform that allows high-density SNP discovery and genotyping in large populations.   
Genotyping by sequencing:  
o	No ascertainment bias.   
o	Restriction enzyme cuts DNA -> fragments have different length  
o	Sort fragments by length and sequence only fragments in specific size range (how big genome size, coverage & budget determines how big range is)   
â€¢	Tag for each individual/pops -> can make multiplex and individually assign amplified sequences
